# 🔧 Payment Methods Update Fix

## ❌ **Problem Identified**
The payment methods update was failing with connection errors because the app was trying to make HTTP requests to a backend API that's not available. The logs showed:

```
I/flutter (15129): type ==> DioExceptionType.connectionError
I/flutter (15129): Error updating payment account: Please check your internet connection and try again
```

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Created Firebase Payment Service**

  - Add new payment accounts
  - Update existing payment accounts
  - Delete payment accounts
  - Process payments (Eversend, MoMo, Card)
