### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Driver**: Access to relevant driver data and incident reporting
- **Vendor**: Access to vendor-specific data and analytics
- **Customer**: Access to order history and personal data

### Data Validation
- Required field validation for critical collections
- Role-based field restrictions (e.g., users cannot change their own role)
- Status field validation for workflow management

### Privacy Protection
- Users can only access their own data
- Admin access is restricted to administrative functions
- Sensitive data (earnings, payouts) restricted to owners and admins

## Implementation Notes

1. **Helper Functions**: The rules use helper functions for consistent role checking
2. **Nested Collections**: Support for document subcollections (e.g., driver documents)
3. **Real-time Updates**: Optimized for real-time tracking and notifications
4. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and security

## Usage Instructions

1. Copy the contents of `firestore-comprehensive.rules` to your Firebase Console
2. Deploy the rules to your Firestore database
3. Test the rules with different user roles to ensure proper access control
4. Monitor the audit logs for security events

## Security Considerations

- All rules follow the principle of least privilege
- Sensitive operations require admin privileges
- User data is protected with owner-based access control
- System collections are admin-only for security
